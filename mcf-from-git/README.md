# Harvest mcf file from git

[mcf](https://geopython.github.io/pygeometa/reference/mcf/) is a metadata format from the geopython community oriented on iso19139:2007

This harvester clones a repository locally and extracts all .yml files
and inserts it in a database, for reuse in the SWR

The concept of storing mcf on git has been introduced by [lsc-hubs](https://github.com/lsc-hubs/kenya-catalogue) and [ejp soil](https://github.com/ejpsoil/ejpsoildatahub), and is currently used by the [soilwise soilinfohub](https://github.com/soilwise-he/soilinfohub) for records which are created in the scope of the project (no option to import from elsewhere)
