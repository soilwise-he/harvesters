# STAC harvester

STAC catalogue is a common cataloguing approach in earth observation repositories such as Copernicus

The copernicus STAC catalogue is available at <https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac>

STAC is organised in collections: [S2GLC](https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac/collections/S2GLC), [TERRAAQUA](https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac/collections/TERRAAQUA), [SENTINEL-5P](https://catalogue.dataspace.copernicus.eu/stac/collections/SENTINEL-5P)

For each collection a range of items (usually grid datasets) is available. In theory collections can also be nested in other collections, for now we just assume a single level of collections.
